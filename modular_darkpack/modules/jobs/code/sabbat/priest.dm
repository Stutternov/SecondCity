The Priest must decide whether or not the dispute is worthy of monomacy. The challenged Cainite gets to decide the terms of the duel, such as weapons, disciplines allowed or not, torpor or final death, and location...

Each Sabbat Cainite who wishes to serve the new Ductus approaches our bathtub, and contributes a large amount of vitae using the ritual knife. The new Ductus then bathes in the blood of the pack which recognizes them, where the Priest then uses the Tome on the bathtub, and upon exiting the bathtub, the Priest is to scoop up the blood in a Vaulderie Goblet, for all to drink of, consecrating the new Pack formation's vinculum. \n"

Woe unto the Cainite who brings some foul beggar with blood that tastes of dirt. This Rite shall be a competition, to see who may offer the most worthy morsel to the communal pack, whether that is a nosy police officer, a Rogue Sabbat Cainite, or a worthy heretical Cainite for diablerie, the strength of the pack shall be shown, and we shall all feast this night. \n"
