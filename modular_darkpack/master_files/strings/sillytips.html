Elkabo, elkabo, pixy queen where all is green.
Ask about the free arsenic!
Maggots love you. Trust me.
There's nothing stopping you from just putting a chew toy in the mouth of a vampire. What are they going to do, bite you?

It's 2009, get over it.

Kinfolk are just ghouls for dogs.
The Black Furies breeding pits do not exist. Do not attempt to breach the Bawn to find it.
Gaia saved next week!
Do you think a Nexus Crawler would improve the feng shui of this landfill?
